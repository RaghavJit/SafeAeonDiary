# Week 14 – April 5, 2025
### Creating and Testing Keeper Rules + Alert Investigation

This week was spent implementing and testing the custom rules for Keeper that I had proposed earlier. We wrote and deployed these rules in a controlled environment, ensuring they triggered accurately and weren’t prone to false positives. Simultaneously, I continued to support the SOC by:

Investigating and reporting new alerts across various consoles

Analyzing login failures to distinguish human vs application behavior

Researching indicators of potential breaches

Week 14 was a mix of engineering work and live alert response, helping me deepen my understanding of both proactive defense and incident handling.
