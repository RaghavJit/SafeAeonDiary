# Week 8 – February 22, 2025
### Shift Assignment and Live SOC Exposure

This week marked a significant milestone in our internship—we were officially assigned shifts and began working inside the SOC room. With all our prior theoretical and tool-based training, we were now ready to experience live alert analysis in a production environment.

We began reviewing real-time alerts across various platforms. Using the knowledge from previous weeks, we were tasked with analyzing alerts, creating detailed reports, and submitting them for review. After a senior analyst's approval, the final reports were posted on Jira as official tickets.

We encountered and analyzed various types of alerts including:

Login failures

Logins from foreign countries

Unusual VPN usage

Malicious file detections

This week, we also became comfortable using tools like VirusTotal for file and hash analysis, and various IP reputation checkers to investigate suspicious IP addresses. This was the first time we truly put theory into practice, sharpening both our technical and decision-making skills in a live security monitoring setting.
