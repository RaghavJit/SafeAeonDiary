# Week 20 – May 17, 2025 (Ongoing)
### Login Failure Alert Optimization – Research Phase

This week is currently in progress, and we’ve started working on one of the most common sources of alert noise—login failure alerts.

Right now, we're:

Analyzing patterns in login failure data.

Identifying suppression opportunities based on usernames, IPs, geolocation, or device types.

Planning a Tines-based noise-reduction workflow to ensure only critical login failures are escalated.

This is part of a larger goal to improve SOC efficiency by removing non-actionable alerts while preserving true positives.
