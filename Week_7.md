# Week 7 – February 15, 2025
### Hands-on with Ticket Management and SOC Workflow

Week 7 continued our focus on internal operations, but this time we got hands-on experience in managing the SOC ticketing workflow ourselves.

We were taught how to open tickets manually in Jira in case the automation doesn’t catch a particular alert. We also practiced reviewing and closing alerts, and learned the importance of assigning the right severity to each ticket. Attention was given to how SafeAeon prefers tickets to be categorized and the standard language they use when communicating with clients.

We also went over the importance of clear communication, documentation, and timelines—skills critical for working in a real SOC environment. By the end of this week, we were familiar with SafeAeon's specific practices for managing alerts, assigning investigations, and following up on tickets with clients.
