### Automating the Audit – Creative Contributions to SOC Efficiency

This week marked a turning point in my internship—I finally took a creative initiative that made a real impact. While continuing the lengthy task of auditing Rapid7 setups across 120+ clients, I realized that much of the process was monotonous and repetitive. Each audit involved checking dashboards, verifying rule configurations, identifying broken cards, and documenting issues—tasks that followed a predictable pattern.

So, I decided to automate parts of the audit process.

I wrote a set of automation scripts that significantly reduced manual effort:

Scripts to fetch and validate Rapid7 dashboards across client environments.

Automated detection of missing cards, broken queries, and disabled rules.

Summarized reports that could be shared with the SRT team for quicker review.

But I didn’t stop there.

I also created automation tools to assist the SOC team in their daily tasks. For example:

A script that closes alerts on both Jira and the console simultaneously, reducing redundant actions.

A script to launch the alert monitoring dashboards on multiple large screens in the SOC room with a single command—making it easier for everyone to stay updated on real-time threats.

Even while building these tools, I continued with the ongoing Rapid7 audit, as the scale of 120+ customers meant there was still a lot of ground to cover. This week helped me apply programming and scripting skills to a real-world cybersecurity environment, and I was proud to contribute something that improved the team’s operational efficiency.
