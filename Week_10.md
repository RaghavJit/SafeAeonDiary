# Week 10 – March 8, 2025
### Advanced Alert Analysis and Understanding Alert Suppression

This week we graduated to handling advanced alerts that required deeper investigation and understanding of endpoint behaviors. We worked with alerts related to:

1. Obfuscated code execution

1. Shadow IT detection

1. Suspicious Windows executable runs

1. Unauthorized applications

We were taught how these alerts could indicate advanced threat behaviors or potential policy violations. However, one of the most important lessons we learned this week was that not every alert needs to be reported. Reporting every alert can overwhelm clients and flood dashboards with noise.

This is where the concept of alert suppression comes in. We were trained to check for existing suppression rules before reporting, ensuring that we didn’t duplicate known benign activity. Suppressions could be based on usernames, device names, IP addresses, geolocations, or specific applications, depending on the unique context of each client. This week sharpened our analytical thinking and emphasized the importance of context-aware alert handling.
