### Fine-Tuning Rapid7 Detection Rules

This week, my work centered around fine-tuning Rapid7, one of SafeAeon’s main SIEM platforms. I was assigned the task of reviewing past alerts and tickets to identify rules with high false positive rates.

After analyzing several cases, I prepared a list of overly sensitive rules and worked with the team to reduce their sensitivity thresholds. This optimization helped in cutting down the noise and ensured that only actionable alerts reached the SOC. It was a great hands-on experience with rule-based detection and data-driven tuning.
