### Onboarding Keeper – Research and Rule Planning

In Week 13, we onboarded a new product: Keeper, a privileged access and password management solution. I was given the responsibility to research Keeper’s logging capabilities and design detection rules for it.

I started by studying Keeper’s documentation, understanding the log types it generates, and how they map to security-relevant events. I compiled a list of potential detection rules based on event types, severity, and user behavior. After completing the rule set, I presented my proposal to the seniors for review and feedback.
