# Week 2 – January 11, 2025
### Understanding Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) with SentinelOne

In the second week of my internship at SafeAeon, we dove deeper into endpoint security by exploring Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems. While I had already been introduced to broader detection systems like XDR (Extended Detection and Response), this week helped me understand how EDR operates as a focused solution for securing endpoints—such as desktops, laptops, and servers.

We began by understanding how EDR differs from XDR. EDR is primarily concerned with protecting endpoint devices by monitoring behavior, detecting threats, and enabling swift responses. In contrast, XDR extends beyond endpoints, integrating data across multiple layers like networks, emails, and cloud services. This distinction clarified the specific role EDR plays within a broader cybersecurity ecosystem.

Our primary focus was on SentinelOne, one of the leading EDR platforms in the industry. We spent considerable time getting comfortable with its graphical user interface (GUI) and how security analysts interact with it. I learned how alerts are presented, including the detailed metadata attached to each event—such as the file path, hash, parent process, affected endpoint, and user account.

An important part of the training was understanding how to analyze a file flagged by SentinelOne, distinguishing between a false positive and a genuinely malicious artifact. We also discussed how to perform file analysis using threat intelligence indicators and behavioral markers.

Towards the end of the week, we were introduced to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, a powerful tool used for mapping tactics and techniques employed by attackers. We learned how SentinelOne integrates MITRE references directly into its alerts, providing context that enhances investigation and response. This was my first exposure to structured threat intelligence models, and I began appreciating how frameworks like MITRE guide both detection and response strategies.
