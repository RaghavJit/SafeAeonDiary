# Week 1 – January 4, 2025

### Introduction to SOC, SOC-as-a-Service, and Cybersecurity Service Models

The first week of my internship at SafeAeon, a company specializing in SOC-as-a-Service, laid the foundational groundwork for everything I would engage with over the coming months. This week was all about familiarization—both with the company and with key cybersecurity concepts that form the bedrock of modern threat monitoring and response systems.

I was introduced to the concept of a Security Operations Center (SOC)—the nerve center of any organization’s cybersecurity infrastructure. I learned how a SOC serves as a centralized unit that deals with security incidents in real-time. The SOC team’s role spans proactive threat hunting, monitoring logs, responding to alerts, and coordinating incident response. At SafeAeon, I saw how a SOC is scaled and delivered as a service (SOC-as-a-Service) to clients across different industries, allowing organizations to have 24x7 security without the need to build such infrastructure in-house.

As part of this introduction, I also explored related service models like MDR (Managed Detection and Response) and XDR (Extended Detection and Response). While MDR focuses on monitoring and analyzing endpoints to detect and respond to threats, XDR takes it a step further by integrating multiple security layers (endpoint, network, cloud, etc.) into a unified threat detection and response system. Understanding the differences between these services helped me appreciate how flexible and adaptive security services can be tailored depending on client needs and organizational scale.

We also briefly touched upon SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems, which play a critical role in log aggregation, correlation, and alerting. SafeAeon’s services rely heavily on SIEM tools to ensure effective detection and centralized visibility into client infrastructure. Additionally, MDM (Mobile Device Management) was introduced as a crucial aspect of enterprise security—particularly for organizations implementing BYOD policies.

By the end of the week, I had also reviewed the complete range of services SafeAeon provides, including vulnerability assessments, threat intelligence, firewall monitoring, log management, and more. This high-level overview helped me understand the broader architecture of cybersecurity service delivery and prepared me for the more technical tasks to follow in the coming weeks.
