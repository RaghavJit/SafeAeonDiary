# Week 3 – January 18, 2025
### Avanan and the Fundamentals of Email Security

Week three shifted our focus from endpoint security to a critical threat vector: email. We were introduced to Avanan, a leading email security platform known for its native integration with cloud email solutions like Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace. This week was all about understanding email-based attacks and the defensive measures employed to combat them.

We began by discussing the importance of email security, especially in the context of phishing, Business Email Compromise (BEC), spoofing, and malware distribution. The session also covered different authentication protocols like SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance). Understanding how these standards validate sender identity and help detect forged messages gave me insight into the building blocks of trust in email communication.

Using the Avanan console, we were shown how email traffic is monitored and filtered. We explored the interface to view and manage alerts, diving into the details that accompany a suspicious or flagged email. Each alert contains information such as sender IP, subject, threat type, and delivery status. We were also introduced to email forensics—examining headers, payloads, and URLs within suspicious messages.

A notable part of the week involved understanding Shadow IT alerts vs Anomaly alerts. Shadow IT alerts point out unsanctioned applications or services being used within an organization, while anomaly alerts indicate behavior that deviates from historical patterns—such as logins from unfamiliar IPs or access outside normal business hours.

This week helped me realize how email remains one of the most exploited entry points in cyber attacks, and how platforms like Avanan form the first line of defense for organizations.
