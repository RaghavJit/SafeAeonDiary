# Week 5 – February 1, 2025
### Advanced Investigations and Log Analysis with Rapid7

Building on the foundation from last week, Week 5 deepened our practical knowledge of Rapid7 InsightIDR. We shifted from basic log exploration to conducting end-to-end investigations within the platform.

We were taught how to open an investigation—a formal process for analyzing a suspicious alert or series of events. This included assigning investigations to analysts, setting severity levels, and tracking progress through resolution. The process mirrored real-world SOC workflows and emphasized how structure is vital when handling security incidents.

Next, we focused on how to view and interpret logs relevant to an ongoing investigation. This involved examining sequences of events to determine if a threat was real, how far it had propagated, and what assets were impacted. We were shown how to correlate events from different log sets to paint a timeline of attacker activity, such as initial access, lateral movement, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.

A major part of this week was understanding different log sets—endpoint logs, firewall logs, DNS queries, authentication attempts, cloud access logs, etc.—and how each plays a unique role in the detection puzzle. We learned to pivot between these log types depending on the nature of the alert and the system being investigated.
