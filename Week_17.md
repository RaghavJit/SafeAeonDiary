# Week 17 – April 26, 2025
### Joining the Automation Team – Learning Tines

This week brought a big change in my internship journey. Based on my consistent contributions and scripting efforts during the SOC auditing phase, I was transferred to SafeAeon’s Automation Department. Before the transfer, I was formally interviewed again by the Automation Team, and upon successful evaluation, I officially joined them.

My introduction to this team began with learning Tines, a powerful automation platform used by SafeAeon for orchestrating security workflows.

Over the week, I familiarized myself with:

Core Actions in Tines: HTTP Request, Webhook, Send Email, Event Transform, etc.

Event Transform Modes: including explode, implode, loop, deduplicate, and message.

Essential Tines Functions such as:

map, mapLambda, filter

JSON.parse, uniq, objectToCsv, and many more.

These building blocks formed the basis of automated incident response and reporting pipelines. I practiced combining these actions into complete workflows and studied existing automations to understand how SafeAeon manages alert processing, customer communications, and report generation efficiently.
