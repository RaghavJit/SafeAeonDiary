# Week 19 – May 10, 2025
### Multi-Workflow Week – Billing Automation, Timezone Accuracy, and Custom Alerts

This week was full of smaller but impactful automation tasks.

Device & Billing Automation:
I built a workflow that fetched a list of all devices from clients' various EDR consoles, matched them with their subscription models, and generated an Excel report for the Billing Department. This replaced a time-consuming manual process.

Timezone-Based Jira Enhancements:
Many errors were occurring in ticket timestamps due to timezone mismatches. I worked on a workflow that automatically appends the client’s local timezone to every Jira ticket, making SOC responses clearer and reducing confusion significantly.

Client-Specific Email Alert Integration:
A client requested email alerts every time a new event appeared in their Rapid7 console. I built and deployed a custom email workflow in Tines that sent clean, formatted alerts directly from Rapid7 to their email, improving visibility and client satisfaction.
