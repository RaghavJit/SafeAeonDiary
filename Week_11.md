# Week 11 – March 15, 2025
### Entering the SRT (SOC Readiness Team)

In Week 11, I transitioned into the SRT – SOC Readiness Team, a specialized unit within SafeAeon focused on reducing workload on the SOC. The team’s core responsibilities include:

Tuning and auditing consoles

Eliminating false positives and unnecessary alerts

Quality assurance

Creating and refining detection rules for SIEM platforms

Researching advanced threats and refining alert strategies

The SRT’s job is proactive rather than reactive, and I immediately saw the impact of our work in helping SOC analysts focus on genuine threats.
