# Week 15 â€“ April 12, 2025
### Auditing Rapid7 Across 120+ Clients

This was a challenging but rewarding week. I was tasked with a full audit of Rapid7 configurations across over 120 customer environments. The audit covered:

Checking which rules were enabled or disabled

Verifying if log sets were correctly parsed

Identifying broken dashboards or missing cards

Spotting errors in saved queries

Ensuring alerts were routed correctly

This required great attention to detail and taught me the importance of maintenance and monitoring of SIEM configurations at scale. By the end of the week, I submitted a comprehensive report outlining all identified issues.
